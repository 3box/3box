## Simple Summary
Ephemeral messages on 3box, for when we don't want messages to persist (like in Threads).

## Abstract
Currently 3Box supports building chat like system though the threads api. However, for building things like trollboxes, or online lists, etc. threads are not the best fit. Ipfs has a feature called pubsub, which is a system for passing messages between peers. Pubsub can be used to create an ephemeral chat system where messages are not persisted anywhere in the network, rather they are just sent across once and seen by anyone online at that point. 

## Motivation
One could create Threads and delete message we don't want persisted, but if we already know we don't want to persist any messages in a chat it makes more sense to simply use pubsub and not save messages from the get-go. Which is why we're working on this new standard for ephemeral messaging.

## Specification

### Room Discovery

Each pubsub room on ipfs has a name that serves as a topic between peers. To distinguish between different rooms within the network and within spaces themselves we employ a domain-like system for naming rooms.

Let `space` be the space the chat is situated in and `room` the specific room we want to chat in. Our pubsub room name will be `3box.chat.space.room`. 

### Peer Discovery

Right now 3Box peers are only connected to the 3Box pinningNode. This makes it impossible for nodes to discover each other and send each other pubsub messages. We need to set up a [Rendezvous](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52910503/how-can-i-get-a-libp2p-rendezvous-server-running) server for peers to find other peers, we also possibly need to enable the DHT (which is still an experimental feature in js-ipfs). Another alternative is to use the **Delegated peer and content routing** described [here](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/tree/master/examples/delegated-routing) and [here](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#configuring-delegate-routers).An important thing to consider is if we want to connect to the default ipfs nodes which would make us part of the entire ipfs network, or if we want to keep our nodes only connected to each other and not the rest of the ipfs network.

### Message signing

We want to make sure that the messages posted in the chat are from the user that they claim to come from. We can do this by internally signing the messages as JWT claims, which 3box already supports. These JWTs can be signed by the space-3id for easy verification. This would all happen behind the scenes in the api though so that consumers of the api wouldn't need to worry about it.

### API

**Joining a chat:**
```js
const chat = await space.joinChat('name-of-chat-room') 
    
chat.on('user-joined', (did) => {
  console.log(did, ' joined the chat')
})
```
This does several things in the background:

1. The user joins a room on `ipfs-pubsub-room` under the name `<room>.<space>`
2. The user broadcasts a message saying that it joined. We do this so that we can also transmit the space-3id we're joining with. A `user-joined` event is also emitted.
3. The space-3id is then received by peers in the room and each peer saves that id to an array of 3ids called `_usersOnline`

**Leaving a chat:**
```js
chat.leaveChat() 
    
chat.on('user-left', (did) => {
  console.log(did, ' left the chat')
})
```
This does several things in the background:

1. The user leaves a room on `ipfs-pubsub-room`
2. The user broadcasts a message saying that it left. We do this so that we can also transmit the space-3id we're leaving with. A `user-left` event is also emitted.
3. The space-3id is then received by peers in the room and each peer deletes that id from `_usersOnline`

**Fetching online users in the chat:**
```js
// returns an array of space-3ids of the users
const userList = chat.onlineUsers()
    
// fetches all ids saved in chat._usersOnline array
```
**Broadcasting a message in the chat:**
```js
chat.send('hello world') 
    
chat.on('message', (did, message) => {
  console.log(`new message from ${did}: ${message}`)
})
```
This does several things in the background:

1. The user signs a message jwt
2. The user broadcasts that jwt in the room
3. Peers decode and verify jwt that are caught
4. Peers reject any message that aren't signed properly or are invalid before they get passed to our on-message event listener
5. Saves all messages in local cache

**Fetching message local message cache:**
```js
// person requesting
const backlog = chat.requestBacklog()
```
In the background:

1. New user broadcasts a message to other peers asking for a backlog
2. Peers directly send the user a message containing the backlog (naive but it works)

**Replying to a message in the chat (maybe out of scope):**
```js
chat.on('message', (did, message) => {
  chat.reply(message, 'this is my reply')
})
    
// chat.reply is treated the same as chat.send and works the same
// as in they get caught by our on message event listener all the same
// may not get build due to being out of scope for initial release
```

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
We're still looking into whether ephemeral messages could be integrated into Threads or whether it should be a seperated module.

## Implementation
To implement this we can likely use `ipfs-pubsub-room` or something similar like [orbit-db-pubsub](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-pubsub) which is already a dependancy for us, but looks more limited.

### **Requirements**

- Should extend the 3box-js library using the api defined above
- Should be able to find all other peers on the same chat within a reasonable time bound
- Should work well in most browsers (including mobile dapp browsers)

### **Testing**

The 3box-js repo has an example-dapp which can be extended in order to test the chat functionality.**Ways to test:**

- Implement tests as part of 3box-js, similar to how other tests are set up in the 3box-js repo now we can set up two ipfs nodes in the test file and have them communicate with each other.

In all of the examples below different 3box accounts are used to send messages in each browser.
- Two browsers same computer, e.g. chrome and firefox
- Two browsers same network but different computers, e.g. phone and desktop connected to the same wifi
- Two browsers different networks, e.g. phone not on wifi and computer on wifi etc
- Come up with more test cases? \o/

Before we go ahead and try to get everything working with discovery, we could test the api by directly connecting nodes. This would allow us to make sure the the API is fully functional by itself.

### **Questions to answer during the implementation process**

- Should we connect to the rest of the ipfs network or keep our network separate?
- What are the tradeoffs?
- What are the differences in performance?

### Module
```js
class GhostChat extends EvenEmitter {

  constructor(name, opts) {
    this.room = new PubsubRoom(name)
  }

}
```
