## What is a 3IP?

3IP stands for 3Box Improvement Proposal. A 3IP document contains information describing new features or other types of changes to the 3Box community. They are intended to be similar to EIPs and BIPs of Ethereum and Bitcoin respectively, but 3IPs won't maintain the same level of formality as the others â€“ for now.

## Creating a 3IP
Simply copy [3ip-X.md](./3ip-X.md) and start writing. Once your proposal is ready, add your file to this repo by making a PR. The number of your PR will become the number of your 3IP.
