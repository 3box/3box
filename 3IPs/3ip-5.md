## Simple Summary
Account linking is the process that describes linking an ethereum address to a 3Box identifier. This 3IP describes how to link a contract wallet specifically.

## Abstract
Currently 3Box supports linking Externally Owned Accounts (EOA). This is done by signing a message containing the DID of the user with their EOA. This signed message serves as a proof that the users ethereum EOA is linked to their 3Box account. With Contract wallets it's not possible to use the same mechanism because a contract has no private key. Instead we use [EIP 1271](http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) which allows a contract to approve of some external signature. This 3IP describes how and where such a EIP 1271 proof should be stored in to link a contract wallet to a 3Box account.

## Motivation
Many wallet projects in the ethereum ecosystem are moving to contract based wallets which provide more security and flexibility to end users. In order for 3Box to be used with all types of ethereum accounts there needs to be a way to link a contract wallet to a 3Box account.

## Specification
The ERC 1271 defines a method `isValidSignature` which takes two arguments `_data` and `_signature`, both of which are of the type `bytes`. We can represent these arguments as `string`. Currently we store the proof from the EOA, as a JSON object, under the `ethereum_proof` key in the users public store. From now on we define the value that is stored under the `ethereum_proof` key as an array of JSON objects. These objects would have the form:
```js
{
  version: 1,
  chainId: <the ID of the EVM based chain>,
  address: <the hex address of the contract>,
  message: <the message that is being signed (should contain the users DID)>,
  timestamp: <the unix time when the message is signed>,
  signature: <hex encoded _signature>
}
```
This allows us to store links to multiple links to addresses on different chains etc. In the example above we would have the `consent_msg` contain a plain text message that would be encoded into `_data`. It is crucial that the `message` contains both the users DID as well as the current `timestamp`, in order to ensure the verifiability of the linking. The format of the `_signature` would depend on the contract wallet implementation.

The objects in the `ethereum_proof` array can also have the form of the previous link format (for EOAs) which we from now on call *version 0*.

### Linking procedure
From a UX perspective the linking procedure should be simple. 3Box would simply request a signature of `message` from the contract wallet software. The resulting signature would be stored under `signature`.

## Rationale
The specification above solves a few different problems. We can now store multiple links to different EOAs and contract wallets since `ethereum_proof` now is an array. We added a version property to the proof object to easily distinguish between different proof formats. Contract wallets, as opposed to EOAs, usually only live on one blockchain. Therefore we introduced the `chainId` property which specifies which EVM compliant chain the contract lives on. This means that in theory 3Box would support linking to any EVM based chain. However support for each chain would need to be individually implemented in 3Box clients. Version 0 of the proofs didn't need to include the address that is being linked. This is because from the signature it is possible to derive the address. For contract wallets this is not true, so the `address` property is now needed. The `timestamp` is added as a measure to ensure that the user can change which DID the ethereum address points to, because it can be used as a way to decide the latest link in case there are multiple.

## Backwards Compatibility
To support the old version of the `ethereum_proof` values we simply need to check if it contains an object or an array. If it's an object we treat it as a *version 0* proof, if it's an array we check the version of each item in the array and treat them accordingly.

## Implementation
No implementation is yet available for this 3IP.
