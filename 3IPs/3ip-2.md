# Threads: A p2p communication protocol

This is the first version of threads. This spec is likely to change.

# Overview

Threads is a feature that enables multiple users to post messages in a sequence. This allows users to communicate asynchronously in many forms. For example it could be used for comments, chats, status updates, etc. The first version of threads uses the [orbitdb logstore](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/master/API.md#orbitdblognameaddress) to create a log of messages that is eventually consistent.

## Access control

This first version of threads will allow anyone to post, without any ability to remove posts. This is achieved by using `write: ['*']` when creating the store in orbitdb.

OrbitDB is [working on adding](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/pull/495) support for access controllers. When they are released we can use them for write access to threads, as well as moderation, and potentially other features as well.

## Thread creation
Threads are created inside of [Spaces](./3ip-1.md). A thread has a `name` which could be any string. For example the name could be the address of a contract if you want to create a thread for commenting on that contract. This essentially means that two different spaces could have their own threads with the same name. When a thread is created it gets the name `3box.thread.<space-name>.<thread-name>` for the orbitdb logstore. The main reason to keep threads separated by spaces is so that a dapp that only have permissions to space `A` should not be able to post in threads created in space `B`.

## API

All of the calls below assume that you have opened a space, for example:
```js
const space = box.openSpace('aGoodSpace')
```

**Join a thread:**
To join a thread simply call the `joinThread` method with the name of the thread to join.
```js
const thread = await space.joinThread(<name>)
```


**Post to a thread:**
To post in a thread the `post` method is used. It can be called with any Object. This post is appended to the end of the thread.
By posting in a thread they automatically subscribe to it if not already subscribed.
```js
await thread.post(<Object>)
```

**Subscribe to a thread:**
Saves the thread to the space with the key `"thread-<name>"`. Mostly this only needs to be called if you wish to subscribe to a thread that you have not posted to already.
```js
await space.subscribeThread(<name>)
```

**Read a thread:**
This function returns an array of posts made in the thread. It's also possible to pass options to limit the number of posts or what posts are return.

```js
const posts = thread.getPosts()
```

**Watch for updates:**
When we receive an update to the thread from the network, the provided function will get called.
```js
thread.onNewPost(post => {})
```

**Unsubscribe from a thread**
Removes the thread from the list of threads that the user is subscribed to.
```js
await space.unsubscribeThread(<name>)
```


**List threads the user is subscribed to**
Lists all threads that the user has interacted with. Returns a list of objects that contains the name of the thread and if the thread is currently open (if the orbitdb store for it is open, and we are actively listening for updates).

```js
const threadNames = space.subscribedThreads()
console.log(threadNames)
> ["3box-chat", "Bounties-issue432"]
```



### Threads REST API
We will also add a rest api for viewing threads when the user doesn't have a space opened. This should be as simple as

```js
const threadData = await Box.getThread(<space-name>, <thread-name>)
```
