This is the suggested template for new 3IPs.

Note that an 3IP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your 3IP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `3ip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the 3IP.-->
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the 3IP.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for 3IPs that want to change the 3Box protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the 3IP solves. 3IP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow the implementation without any major question marks.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
All 3IPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The 3IP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. 3IP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any 3IP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the 3IP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
