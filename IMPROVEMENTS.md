# Proposed Improvements

This section contains requested improvements to 3Box. They're definitely important to our community and will be included in future [sprints](./SPRINTS.md) when they become more urgent and requested. *This list is definitely non-exhaustive and will be continuously updated.*

* Decentralize [`3box-address-server`](https://www.github.com/uport-project/3box-address-server)

* Improve access control to the private data store
