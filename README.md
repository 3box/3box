3Box is a distributed user data network that supports public and private data for Ethereum users. All data is publicly available, but private data can only be decrypted by dapps that the user has given explicit permission. We provide a [social profiles dapp](https://3box.io) that allows users to create and manage their profile and a web3 [developer API](https://github.com/3box/3box-js) that makes it easy to onboard users and set/get data from their profile.

# 3Box Overview
The 3Box system primarily consists of the [3Box.js API](https://github.com/3box/3box-js), a distributed user data network, and the [3Box Profiles App](https://3box.io).

## 3Box.js API
[`3box-js`](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-js) is a client-side JavaScript library and API that allows applications to integrate with the 3Box data network. The 3Box.js API allows developers to read, write, and delete public and private data associated with the user. This library can be used to get profile information about an address, set profile information about an address, and onboard users. The 3Box.js API is available via a REST API and a GraphQL endpoint.

[`3box-graphql`](https://github.com/3box/3box-js-graphql) is a GraphQL endpoint that allows developers to write more efficient 3Box.js getProfile() queries. Now developers can ask our API for specific common user profile fields instead of needing to return the entire profile. For example, this is useful when querying for name and image for hundreds or thousands of profiles at once.

## 3Box Data Network
The 3Box user data network consists of a few core components: the [pinning server](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-pinning-server), the [address server](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-address-server), and a [caching service](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-caching-service). Together these components are used to keep track of user data stored in [`orbit-db`](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) instances on IPFS. 

We assume that end-users have a web3-compatible browser or wallet (such as MetaMask or Status) which supports personal_sign. This is how users authenticate dapps to their 3Box. Learn more about the [3Box architecture and how we do access control with encryption](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 3Box Pinning Server
[`3box-pinning-server`](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-pinning-server) is a service operated by 3Box that pins 3Box user data on the IPFS network to ensure availability. In the future this service will become more decentralized with a network of pinning nodes, allowing others to run their own node and host their own data if desired.

### 3Box Address Server
[`3box-address-server`](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-address-server) is a server utilizing a REST API that is used to associate an Ethereum address with its 3Box DID (decentralized identifier), to which all user data is addressed. This is what must be looked up to retrieve and sync the user's data. In the future this service will become more decentralized by putting this address to DID mapping on-chain.

### 3Box Identity
['muport-core-js'](https://github.com/3box/muport-core-js) lorem ipsum. Say something about DIDs and associating data to the DID instead of the Ethereum address. This abstraction allows our system to interoperate with other decentralized identity providers and the DIF. DIDs allow multiple Ethereum addresses to be associated with the same 3Box, and allow for other security and usability features such as address rotation that allows users to change their Ethereum address without losing all of their  data.

### 3Box Caching Service
[`3box-caching-service`](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-caching-service) is a server-side caching service for the pinning server that improves performance of the 3Box.js API. The caching service is optional, but is enabled by default.

## 3Box Profiles Application
The [3box.io](https://3box.io) dapp is how users manage their 3Box data, including profile information and other.

### 3Box Web App
[`3box-dapp`](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-dapp) is a [web interface](https://3box.io/) that allows users to interact with their 3Box profile. The 3Box app works with all standard desktop and mobile web3 browsers including MetaMask, Status, Coinbase Wallet, and others.

### Activity Feed
[`3box-activity`](https://www.github.com/3box/3box-activity) is an API that makes it easy to construct activity feeds for Ethereum users. Part of Ethereum Profiles on the 3Box web app.

### 3Box Verifications
[`3box-verifications`](https://github.com/3box/3box-verifications) is a service that allows [3box.io](https://3box.io) users to verify their Github and Twitter social accounts and link them to their 3Box profile.

# More Information

## Project Goals
* Make it easy for users to share information publicly, while preserving privacy when desired
* Improve the onboarding experience for decentralized applications by making it easy for developers to get information about Ethereum users
* Improve Ethereum usability with distributed database infrastructure that works in production today
* Provide a decentralized system, but pragmatically utilize centralized components to facilitate the transition
