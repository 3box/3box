3Box Labs is a Web3 product studio that creates software to advance a more open, safe, and collaborative web. We are the inventors and a core maintainer of Ceramic, a decentralized network for composable data. Permissionless data composability will inevitably network all of the information on the web, transform the way we build applications, and connect users to their data, and each other, in new and exciting ways.
