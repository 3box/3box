### Join the 3Box Chat

[**Join the 3Box Community**](https://mailchi.mp/c671ca2b8093/3box) so you can connect with other developers and the core team on our Discord Chat.

## Tools

### Issues and Stories
We use **Github Issues** for individual items of work, such as issues, tasks, and stories. Here's an example.

### Issue Labels and Tags
We use **Github Labels** to label issues. Using labels helps keep issue lists and project boards skimmable.

`Development`

`Tech Research`

`Front End`

`Ops`

`Design`

`Content & Community`

`Customer Development`


### Project Management
