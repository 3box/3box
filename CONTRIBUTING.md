This document provides an overview of how you can contribute to 3Box. We're excited to have you building with us. üéâ

## Getting Started
This section contains useful links to get you started building.

### View the Project Board

To view our active work, [view the 3Box project board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/uport-project/3box/boards?repos=139279908,146687169,146688532,145592766,145133349) or [download the Zenhub browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension).

### Join the Chat

[Join the 3Box Community](https://mailchi.mp/c671ca2b8093/3box) so you can connect with other developers and the core team on our Discord Chat.

### Report an Issue or Bug

Some guidelines for reporting bugs:

- Make sure that your issue is caused by the corresponding 3box library and not your application code.
- Create a simple and minimal test case that demonstrates the bug.
- Search the issues to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add any additional details in the comments.
- Write a descriptive and specific title.
- Include browser, OS, 3box library version and any other details specific to the environment.
- Check whether the bug can be reproduced in other environments (ie. other browsers).

## Tools

### Issues and Stories
We use **Github Issues** for individual items of work, such as issues, tasks, and stories. Here's an example.

### Issue Labels and Tags
We use **Github Labels** to label issues. Using labels helps keep issue lists and project boards skimmable.

`Tech Research`

`Front End`

`Customer Development`


### Project Management
